🌱 Born into a family of farmers, I was making cheese 🧀 by age 6.

🤯 At 10, I shocked my parents by saying I was fascinated with the human mind, not farming.

🖥️ I thought the best way to understand it was to build it, so I studied computer science.

🎓 Got a master’s in AI and started using tech to help people.

🦽 Worked with hospitalized seniors on AI-powered wheelchairs, sharing control between human and machine.

🧠 That experience pushed me to study psychology. I loved it so much I graduated as a psychologist.

❤️ I fell for social action and exploring how science, tech, and society intersect.
